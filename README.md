# scrypts

This is meant to be a repository for my bash scrypts and python(3) scrypts made
for some quick things or because it is more convenient that writing a program
for it.

Yes, I have a habit of writing "scrypt" instead of "script". This habit started
when I was mining Litecoin and Dogecoin back in 2014.
